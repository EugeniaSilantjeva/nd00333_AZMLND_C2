# Operationalising Machine Learning

## Overview
The project consists of two parts. The aim of the first part is to configure, deploy and consume a cloud-based ML production model using Azure. The aim of the second part is to create, publish and consume a pipeline. The Bank Marketing dataset is used to train the models in the first and the second parts.


## Architectural Diagram

![](Images/Diagram.JPG)

*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps

### Project main steps
1.	Authentication
2.	Automated ML Experiment
3.	Deploy the best model
4.	Enable logging
5.	Swagger Documentation
6.	Consume model endpoints
7.	Create and publish a pipeline
8.	Documentation
